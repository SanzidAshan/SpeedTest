#Upcoming update

A vital update is in progress - the update will make the app work again - for some unknown reason it didn't want to work appropriately. This should be fixed in the update. 

Other items in the update:

  - Removing Christmas themed icons. 
  
  - Removing/Replacing icons. 
  
  - Minfiying code to create a smaller and better performed app. 
  

#SpeedTest App For Android 







#Current Features:

  - Notifications
   
  - Mobile Site Design
  
  - Basic Usage. 
  
  As of now the app really doesn't function. I am working on this with daily updates. We could Hit Version 50 before I put it in the App Stores. 
  But that is okay, because I want a smooth sailing app!

  - UI Adjustments
