After this week, maintenance will be done bi-weekly. A Schedule of down times - no more than a few hours will be posted soon. 

Update: [here](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/blob/gh-pages/maintenance.pdf) is the PDF of the schedule. Few notes: Not written in stone, The release dates are not guaranteed, not all were included. More or less maintenance could occur. 



 
 
#Open Beta Tester version to be launched. *Now Launched!*

You can now access the Beta Tester Version from the Home Screen. Or see it right [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Beta/beta.html)

Please remember everything in the beta tester version is in a "AS IS" state, expect bugs. 


The [Open Beta Tester](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/Open-Beta-Version-to-be-launched) Version will feature coming up features of the stable project. And will enable testing to give the best possible experience. As of now, UI testing is going to be first to be experimented. A Special button to use the Beta version instead will be added soon. Of course you don't have to use the beta version, but if you want to help make SpeedTest better, than please give it a go :) 

Thanks!

#SpeedTest Vs others

Speedtest uses NO flash. And that makes it mobile compatible. It Meets the HTML5 standards. Open source. NO ADS vs. A bunch of ADS.

Others Uses Flash NOT compatible in mobile browsers- Requires you to download a app on your mobile device. NOT HTML5 compliant. has ALOT of ADS. NOT open source


SpeedTest uses NO external sources except the photo is on a different github repository to give a more accurate reading, in the beta testing stages results showed a 40% accuracy improvment. 
The Jquery is for closing a dialog to show update notices. And is NOT a vital part of the project.
We also use another source to display IP Addresses however, in our archives we had our own with other IPs
The IP Feature is not included in the widget version 

We never collect cookies personally however, Github may.
