*Patch 1.4.4.3*

*Experimental Release!!*

This Patch release, I temporarily removed the Mobile Site Redirect. 

The Main site should be mobile responsive, and I will make adjustments accordingly to do so. 

The "slim UI" Concept will be discontinued regardless, if I decide to keep the mobile site or not, as it has created more issues than what it is worth.

# speedTest Vs others

SpeedTest is entirely JS & HTML5 powered, this means it is compatible on ALL platforms!

The SpeedTest App For Android is powered the same way, but formatted differently. The goal with that is to offer a light app easy to use, and easy to reach. 

SpeedTest now uses some 3rd party components but many of them are open source. 

The Portable Version or Basic Bare Bones version which you can use on your site, doesn't have any 3rd party components. 

Some Third-Party Components:

*Main Project*

  - ClipBoard.js (Allows you to copy your results)
  
  - Li.IO (Provides your IP address more accurate)
  
  - One-Signal (Notifications)
  
 *Android App*
  
   - Cordova PhoneGap (Powers the App)
   
   - One-Signal (Notifications)
   
   - ClipBoard.js (Allows you to copy your results)
   
   - Li.IO (Provides your IP address more accurate)
   
# Installation 

Installing is pretty easy. All you have to do is go [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Pages/portable.html) and follow the directions - There is even a extender guide, to get the most out of this project for your own use. 

This is a live project meaning it isn't really a library - but you can def. use this in your project but following that guide. 

CSS as well as set up is on you. All other design is copyrighted. And shouldn't be used. Please incorporate your own project. The portable version is for those who want or need such utility.
