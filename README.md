*Version 1.0A*
There will be two parts to this release and many "fixer" releases-

As  I added some ads, to raise development funds, you may experience issues with the mobile site, do not worry I will fix this!!! 

And officially, speedtest 2.0 was discontinued. Even though several days ago I announced it's retirement.

More information about the newly added Ads, will be ready soon.


#SpeedTest Vs others

Speedtest uses NO flash. And that makes it mobile compatible. It Meets the HTML5 standards. Open source. A few ads vs. A bunch of ADS.

Others Uses Flash NOT compatible in mobile browsers- Requires you to download a app on your mobile device. NOT HTML5 compliant. has ALOT of ADS. NOT open source
