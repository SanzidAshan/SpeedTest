#Funding Campaign:

I have added ads to create a little revenue to take this project farther. 

You can also donate to this project by going <a href="http://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/donate.html">here</a>







#Current Version! 

#*Version 1.0.2.1B*

- Removed ads 

For now I have decided that ads are not the best funding and are more annoying than what it is worth. You can however donate to the project via paypal.
#*Version 1.0.2B*

- Fixed Ad issue. 

- Added Mobile Ads And Desktop Ads.*

- Adjusted a few things in Embed Version (portable)

*Mobile ads will be shown if your device is a certain size, adjustments will be made accordingly. 

*Version 1.0B*

New Feature : 
- Find out your IP address.

Fixed: 
- issues with ads blocking the main components.

- Different type of ads on each page. 

Notice: No ads will be shown for the time being on the Find My IP test. 

P.S. The IP test comes from: https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips

*Version 1.0A*
There will be two parts to this release and many "fixer" releases-

As  I added some ads, to raise development funds, you may experience issues with the mobile site, do not worry I will fix this!!! 

And officially, speedtest 2.0 was discontinued. Even though several days ago I announced it's retirement.

More information about the newly added Ads, will be ready soon.


#SpeedTest Vs others

Speedtest uses NO flash. And that makes it mobile compatible. It Meets the HTML5 standards. Open source. A few ads vs. A bunch of ADS.

Others Uses Flash NOT compatible in mobile browsers- Requires you to download a app on your mobile device. NOT HTML5 compliant. has ALOT of ADS. NOT open source
