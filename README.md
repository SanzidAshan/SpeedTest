#Down-Time 2/23/17

Downtime will come in intervals of brief periods. I  am working on enhancments that will make the application improve overall. 

Thanks for using SpeedTest


#Performance Enhancments Experiment. 

A Experiment was conducted to try and capture the speed to a certain extent that will greatly improve results but be accurate on any bandwidth (Speed). 

While SpeedTest can *not* be 100% accurate we sure can try and be as accurate as possible. 

So, I ran a little experiment by playing with some varibles I was able to increase the results. Improving accuracy. This was just increasing a varible in the equation that solves the problem, which is what your speed is. So I fixed a bug, or a enhancment that was needed. 

Either way I wrote up a final analysis of my review - See this [here](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/Minor-Code-Adjustments-Greatly-Improved-Accuracy---The-Patch-1.4.2.2-Experiment)



#Version 1.4.2 Maintenance

  - Last few enhancments
  
  - Improvments in accuracy. 
  
  - Cache Fixes. 

 *Patch 1.4.2.2  Completed*

*Main release*
There are some changes to be made over the next couple days. 

   - Color Fixes
   
   - Performance Fixes 
   
   - Remove unneccessary Code
   
   - Bug fixes and general improvments. 
   
   It seems the color scheme change isn't just right, and so I am going to take tomorrow to sort it out, and make some fixes in the code - overall it will take 2-3 weeks to get this done completly, but the changes will reduce the code greatly. And increase performance. 
 The reason it is going to take so much time is because there is a lot of code to mess around with - And it will take some extra time to make some changes to better your experience. 
 
 See the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/1.4.2.1-Release-Notes-New-Features-and-more) for more details as well as some new features. 
 
 **App Update**
 
 The app is becoming more stable! As it does more of the other features will be rolling in soon! I am going to be adding a basic user account system and syncing it with the app soon. See the details of the App Update in the [wiki](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/App-Update--Spring-2017)

#Open Beta Tester version to be launched. *Now Launched!*

You can now access the Beta Tester Version from the Home Screen. Or see it right [here](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Beta/beta.html)

Please remember everything in the beta tester version is in a "AS IS" state, expect bugs. 


The [Open Beta Tester](https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/Open-Beta-Version-to-be-launched) Version will feature coming up features of the stable project. And will enable testing to give the best possible experience. As of now, UI testing is going to be first to be experimented. A Special button to use the Beta version instead will be added soon. Of course you don't have to use the beta version, but if you want to help make SpeedTest better, than please give it a go :) 

Thanks!




#A Project outlook of 2017

As we go into the new year - there are some very new and large goals to make from this project. 
You can find those details <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/SpeedTest-2017-outlook">Here</a>

#Embed Version to be replaced and Depreciated.

#Thanks!

Thanks for supporting SpeedTest.

#SpeedTest Vs others

Speedtest uses NO flash. And that makes it mobile compatible. It Meets the HTML5 standards. Open source. NO ADS vs. A bunch of ADS.

Others Uses Flash NOT compatible in mobile browsers- Requires you to download a app on your mobile device. NOT HTML5 compliant. has ALOT of ADS. NOT open source


SpeedTest uses NO external sources except the photo is on a different github repository to give a more accurate reading, in the beta testing stages results showed a 40% accuracy improvment. 
The Jquery is for closing a dialog to show update notices. And is NOT a vital part of the project.
We also use another source to display IP Addresses however, in our archives we had our own with other IPs
The IP Feature is not included in the widget version 

We never collect cookies personally however, Github may.
