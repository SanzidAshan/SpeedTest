#SpeedTest App For Android 

#Current Features:

  - Notifications
   
  - Mobile Site Design
  
  - Basic Usage. 
  
  As of now the app really doesn't function. I am working on this with daily updates. We could Hit Version 50 before I put it in the App Stores. 
  But that is okay, because I want a smooth sailing app!

#Version 1.1.1 Changes

  - Removed unneeded files creating a lighter app. 
  
  - Make it more functioning 
     - Adding the main component
     
  
#Information On IP Feature

*Update* Looks like I will be able to add it. It will be a main beta feature.
