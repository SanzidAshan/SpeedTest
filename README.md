#SpeedTest Vs others

Speedtest uses NO flash. And that makes it mobile compatible. It Meets the HTML5 standards. Open source. NO ADS vs. A bunch of ADS.

Others Uses Flash NOT compatible in mobile browsers- Requires you to download a app on your mobile device. NOT HTML5 compliant. has ALOT of ADS. NOT open source


SpeedTest uses NO external sources except the photo is on a different github repository to give a more accurate reading, in the beta testing stages results showed a 40% accuracy improvment. 
The Jquery is for closing a dialog to show update notices. And is NOT a vital part of the project.
We also use another source to display IP Addresses however, in our archives we had our own with other IPs
The IP Feature is not included in the widget version 

We never collect cookies personally however, Github may.

#Developers!

To use this on your own project or website please use CSS, that is Not included for the time being. 

#How to install!

To install, just use the embed version! To style this version, you just need to name it a class and add in custom CSS. 

See <a href="https://github.com/jdc20181/SpeedTest/wiki/Installing-SpeedTest">Installing SpeedTest wiki</a> for more info!
