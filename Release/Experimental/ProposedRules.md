#About

These will be considered rules, a strategy, that will keep this project healthy and useful. 

*What are rules?*

A rule in coding, generally is enforcing something within the code that allows you to use it a certain way, such as a JS API may only allow so many uses. 

Essentially, what is being done with the portable version is I am enforcing a Versioning "Conduct" rule that forces you to use the latest version. 

*Set Backs of the proposed rule*

This I am totaly unsure of but the biggest one, is usefulness, effectivness, how stable will the environment it is used be if I change the code. 

*Changes that will occur*

The first change is simple, you need to be sure to use the latest verison, or a small "You are using a out of date version of the SpeedTest Portable Version Lib."

Nothing else will happen, until - 

It is 3 Minor Versions from the newest stable release. A minor version is in a version like so: Major.Minor.Build.Patch

After the 3 minor versions, you will be forced to upgrade, or be disconnected, making users sent to a `ERROR 404` page - or similar. 

**THESE CHANGES ARE ONLY EXPERIMENTAL AND SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED AS A RULE JUST YET.**
