#**Important**

This is **NOT** for production use of any sort. It is a work in porgress, and shouldn't be used publically. 

*Security notice*

I Am currently working on this, so its insecure, and I take no responsibility if you do not take the disclaimer seriously. 



#About

This is the experimental section of the Portable Version of the SpeedTest project. It is designed to take off into a Javascript API to help developers spread the message on accurate service. 

At this time this part of SpeedTest is off limits for production use. 

Updates about this will be presented in the main Readme, and on the site, and in the app,when they are ready. 

The Current version of the portable version begins the goals of the Portable Version Sub-Project, but, it is neccessary to push forward with the development - creating a more usable Library. 



Recently I pushed a update that restricts the results to MBPS only, as the rest will jumble the mobile experience UI up. The whole goal of the portable version is easily make the changes yourself or automatically, but the approach the main project is taking, is different from what a portable version can. 

A new version of the portable version is coming soon, and will be more stable than the current one is. 

#Considerations

  - Using a Iframe type API
  
Using Iframes was one of the very first things I did with the Portable version, but that was really unstable, so I depreciated it, and re-released the embedable version into a portable version, one more customizable, but not 100% where I wanted it to end up. 

 - Provide a JS Lib File

Current Portable version is exactly this. I offer you the JS File hosted by github - on this respo. 

This works great until I want to make changes, and as a normal libary works, you don't just delete a version. But I want to be able to force updates into existing files, mostly making it more stable. So, there are some new rules I am working on to enforce these rules. 

See this in the `ProposedRules.MD` file in this folder.
