As you imagine, the internet isn't that old. The first time internet came around as we know it today was in the 1960's. This early internet was only available to military personnel. 

The internet is basically just a bunch of computers communicating with files among them. Really, things like google drive already existed some years ago. This is because of how the web works. 
</p>
<p>
The Web:

Server: Website >>>> Internet provider >>> You

The Website sits on a computer that holds only the data of the website, this makes it more secure as with other factors but, biggest thing to think is that you don't need your other documents accessed. 

The internet is much more complex and much more things go on to get to you, but this is the general output. </p>
