As you imagine, the internet isn't that old. The first time internet came around as we know it today was in the 1960's. This early internet was only available to military personnel. 

The internet is basically just a bunch of computers communicating with files among them. Really, things like google drive already existed some years ago. This is because of how the web works. 
</p>
<p>
The Web:

Server: Website >>>> Internet provider >>> You

The Website sits on a computer that holds only the data of the website, this makes it more secure as with other factors but, biggest thing to think is that you don't need your other documents accessed. 

The internet is much more complex and much more things go on to get to you, but this is the general output. </p>

<h1 id="C2">Chapter 2 Internet Speed</h1>
Internet speed comes in many types based on the type of internet:

Cell Internet

Satellite Internet

DSL Internet

Fiber optic internet

Dial Up

Other Means




Cell internet or Phone Data as some call it is transmitted using cell towers from the area you are located. 

<table >

    <td>Generation</td>
    <td>2G</td>
    <td>3G</td> 
    <td>4G</td>
    <td>4G LTE</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Speed</Td>
    <td>9.6-14.4 kbps</td>
    <td>500-700 kbps</td> 
    <td>1-3Mbps</td>
    <td>3-5 Mbps</td>
  </tr>
</table>


The other various types are "Home" Based types meaning you can't take them with you. 


The Mother of today's internet comes from Dial-Up. 

What is Dial-Up? Dial-Up is internet provided through your home phone line. 

It is very poor quality, but is still commonly used today. 


The "General" type of internet is DSL or Fiber Optic. 

DSL or Digital Subscriber Line is one of the most powerful standards in internet. This is limited to mostly city limits, and isn't widely available to rural areas. 

Fiber Optic or FIOS meaning Fiber Optic Services, is the same as DSL but, can reach peaker speeds. 

Satellite internet, which is the revolution in technology is actually meant to become a replacement of DSL or FIOS and is available anywhere (Exclusions apply) is the moderate quality internet. This is because you are limited on what you can do, you have a data cap like on your cell phone, making it hard to get important computer updates or anything really at all.


Other Means of internet are things like Wireless Broadband which is usually dispensed by a Antenna and communicates to various towers.

<h1 id="C3">Chapter 3  Summary </h1>

<h1>Summary</h1>

Regardless of how you connect, your speed can be impacted by many ways. Your carrier's equipment, usually even older equipment can make speeds slower than they actually should be. If you are suppose to get 15 mbps and only are getting 8mbps call your provider and express your concern. 


<h1>Fixes</h1>

Check a hard wire version of your internet, sometimes it is your router. Just use the Cord instead. If this is true, consider that your router may be old, and purchase a new one.

Your internet provider. Depending where you live this option may not be possible. Especially if you live in areas that satilite internet is avialble only, as Excede, WildBlue, And Hughes are pretty much the same, Hughes Net is the "owner" of the data centers in outter space, other companies purchase or lease it for thier own interest*

*Based on facts, and speculations. I do not hold any involvment with any of the companies listed.

<h1>Retesting</h1>

It is Best to try the test 3 times. Take note of your speed. If it varies a lot, retest again. It should be close together.
