#Beta Testing. 

Go [Here](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Beta/beta.html) to access the Beta Testing version. 


#Formatting - Beta System. 

The Beta System, is a seperate version that will integrate possible features of future versions of SpeedTest. Once a feature is tested - it will be placed into the 
stable version, and removed from the beta test version. 

The Beta Test version does *NOT* hold anything special. It is just a buggy version of some features needing to be tested before I can release them. 

It is optional, and not required to use this version. 

#Currently Testing:

*New UI*


The New UI will have several things included. First, instead of the Loading text, the plan is to instead add a progress spinner. 
This simple change improves the UI by about 15%

The next UI Change is the Results screen altogether. The plan is to animate the area a little more to make it more fancy. 

*Upload Speed*

The newest addition will be showing your Upload speed. Doing this will be tricky. 

#Contributing. 

To contribute, I simply need feedback. If you aren't a developer - I especially need *your* feedback. Use the Support Chat to send feedback. 

#Notice!

**Code is NOT for production use outside of this is respo. This is a Testing part of the project for upcoming new features!**
