#About - Purpose. 

The purpose of the Terms of Service and Private Policy is to provide the best service and maintain a good relationship with you the user and the
health of this project. 

The Terms are pretty simple, but they are binding. By using SpeedTest you agree to them. This document here is to process them down into a lower less flashy
word choice, and explain what they are for. 

#[Terms Of Service.](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Pages/Policy.html#TermsOfService)

By using SpeedTest, more like if you create a user account, you understand that you have the right to use the features linked to your account as well as premium ones. 

Please remember the "Use License" Section ONLY applies to user accounts. The project overall is shipped as MIT. I will never charge anyone for porting the the Portable versrion. 

#[Private Policy](https://jdc20181.github.io/SpeedTest/Pages/Policy.html#PrivatePolicy)

In order to provide this service, I may eventually start using your local storage on your device storing things such as your login info, account access keys etc. 

This is so I can provide the services via user accounts. 

#Applies to?
