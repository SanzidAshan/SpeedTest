<p><strong>Introducing User Accounts.</strong></p>
<p>User Accounts will be integrated soon! The introduction will be very simple, not much really. You will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to change your information for the first few weeks.</p>
<p>Adding User Accounts will also add a Private Policy &amp; Terms of Service Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline on Accounts</strong></p>
<p>Accounts will be added soon! I have no timeline - Currently but here is a briefing of how it will come together.</p>
<p><em>First</em></p>
<p>You will have an anonymous account - you can create a account but if you uninstall the app your information is lost forever.</p>
<p>So please do not uninstall the app because everything you do is and will be important to this feature.</p>
<p><em>Second</em></p>
<p>Adding the Database  - saving the account information so no matter whether you are on a Android phone or tablet you will be synced with the same data.</p>
<p>With this addition will also bring the features of a user account.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avatar Photos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statuses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free Community Support for your issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tips and tricks to getting a faster speed based on your results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And many other personalized features just for you!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Third</em></p>
<p>As you may know in the micro fine print not everything will be added at once due to the way things go around here. Typically you will get about 1-2 features added in a update. So, it may take several updates to add everything.</p>
<p>#Visual Changes <em>again</em></p>
<p>This first time trial run didn’t go so great so I am going to completely wipe it clean and start over.</p>
<p>The visual changes will make it feel more like a app and look like one too!</p>
<p>#Introducing Video Ads.</p>
<p>I know I know its a pain. But If I do not show ads I won’t be getting this into the play store ASAP.</p>
<p>Ads will be limited to a special speficiation and will be able to be removed with a premium account feature down the road.</p>
<p>All user’s registered <strong>Before</strong> a To be announced deadline will automatically be enrolled in the premium account feature for no cost. Just for using the app. The catch is you must provide feedback. To do this you can <a href="mailto:jdc20181@yahoo.com">email</a> me.</p>
<p>And of course more features will be around soon!</p>
